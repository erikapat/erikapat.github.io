Welcome to my personal web page!

<p> Until not so long ago I worked as pre-doctoral researcher at the UC3M, in Madrid, where I did my doctoral research on topics related with the use of **maxentropic methodologies** for the estimation of the capital requirements for banks. The methodology that I used has **several applications** in **insurance (premium calculations), finance(pricing) and statistics (density estimation, clustering, ...)**, between others. I am built this webpage (**still work in progress**) to show my work along, with applications and examples of this methodology (also work in progress). </p>



This webpage is in its initial stage, so there aren't many things on here yet; but you'll find a little bit about my work, figures and articles that I put up here and that are mostly a result of little experiments that I read, hear or perform in the past.
